## Debugging

#### QUESTIONS: BIOS 

>B1: What is the first instruction that gets executed?
>>ljmp   $0xf000,$0xe05b

>B2: At which physical address is this instruction located?
>>0xffff0


#### QUESTIONS: BOOTLOADER

>B3: How does the bootloader read disk sectors? In particular, what BIOS interrupt is used?
>>By using BIOS interrupt, serial(0x14).

>B4: How does the bootloader decides whether it successfully finds the Pintos kernel?
>>  It reads the partition table on each system hard disk and scan for a partition of type 0x20.  
>>  This type means the Pintos kernel has been found.


>B5: What happens when the bootloader could not find the Pintos kernel?
>>It will print the string "\rNot found\r" and notify BIOS that boot failed(0x18).

>B6: At what point and how exactly does the bootloader transfer control to the Pintos kernel?
>>  At line 168 in file loader.S, the bootloader transfers control to the Pintos kernel by a indirectly jump instruction "ljmp *start", after the kennel being loaded. The loader has to store the 32-bit address and then jump indirectly through that location since the 80x86 doesn't have an instruction to jump to an absolute segment:offset kept in registers.

>>	mov %es:0x18, %dx  
>>	mov %dx, start  
>>	movw $0x2000, start + 2  
>>	ljmp *start             <--here

#### QUESTIONS: KERNEL

>B7: At the entry of pintos_init(), what is the value of expression `init_page_dir[pd_no(ptov(0))]` in hexadecimal format?
>>0x00

>B8: When `palloc_get_page()` is called for the first time,
>> B8.1 what does the call stack look like?
>>
>>>  #0  palloc_get_page (flags=(PAL_ASSERT | PAL_ZERO)) at ../../threads/palloc.c:113  
>>>  #1  0xc00204a8 in paging_init () at ../../threads/init.c:218  
>>>  #2  0xc0020412 in pintos_init () at ../../threads/init.c:146  
>>>  #3  0xc002013d in start () at ../../threads/start.S:180
>>
>> B8.2 what is the return value in hexadecimal format?
>>
>>>  0xc0101000
>>
>> B8.3 what is the value of expression `init_page_dir[pd_no(ptov(0))]` in hexadecimal format?
>>
>>>  0x00



>B9: When palloc_get_page() is called for the third time,
>> B9.1 what does the call stack look like?
>>
>>>  #0  palloc_get_page (flags=PAL_ZERO) at ../../threads/palloc.c:112  
>>>  #1  0xc0020b7f in thread_create (name=0xc002e9c5 "idle", priority=0, function=0xc0020fae <idle>, aux=0xc000efbc) at ../../threads/thread.c:178  
>>>  #2  0xc0020a74 in thread_start () at ../../threads/thread.c:111

>>>  #4  0xc002013d in start () at ../../threads/start.S:180
>>
>> B9.2 what is the return value in hexadecimal format?
>>
>>>  0xc0103000

## Kernel Monitor

>C1: Put the screenshot of your kernel monitor running example here. (It should show how your kernel shell respond to `whoami`, `exit`, and `other input`.)
>>![kernel monitor](D:\OperatingSystem\pintos\docs\kernelshell.png)

#### 

>C2: Explain how you read and write to the console for the kernel monitor.
>>The kernel monitor reads and displays the command by the function getline() declared in threads/init.c. It reads the user's input from the keyboard buffer(through input_getc()) and diaplays the characters on the screen(through printf()) one by one. This getline process will terminate either the "enter" key('\r') is decated or user's input reaches the length limitation.
