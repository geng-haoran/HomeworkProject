## Argument Passing

#### DATA STRUCTURES

>A1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed struct or struct member, global or static variable, typedef, or enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

None

#### ALGORITHMS

>A2: Briefly describe how you implemented argument parsing.  How do you arrange for the elements of argv[] to be in the right order?
>How do you avoid overflowing the stack page?

The initial position of ESP is PHYS_BASE, and it decreases when pushed down. The segmented parameters (n strings) are pushed in, in no particular order because they will be referenced by pointers later. ESP is aligned to a position divisible by 4 (because the total length of the previously pushed strings can be arbitrary), which can improve performance. An empty pointer (sentinel) is first pushed, followed by the addresses of each parameter string in right-to-left order, forming the argv array. The address of argv[0] and the number of parameters, argc, are pushed. The address of argv[0] is actually the value of ESP after step 4 is completed. Finally, a fake return address (0) is pushed.

#### RATIONALE

>A3: Why does Pintos implement strtok_r() but not strtok()?


strtok_r() is safe for threads and preferred for its greater flexibility. Unlike strtok(), which only saves the save_ptr value in a fixed location, strtok_r() returns the save_ptr value to the user. Therefore, after calling strtok() on string S, all subsequent calls on string S must be completed because we don't have a pointer to the remaining part of the string.

>A4: In Pintos, the kernel separates commands into a executable name and arguments.  In Unix-like systems, the shell does this separation.  Identify at least two advantages of the Unix approach.

By performing validity checks before passing commands to the kernel, the shell can reduce the likelihood of kernel errors and improve kernel processing time.


## System Calls

struct child_info
{

  struct thread *t;                   // Child's thread.
  int exit_code;                      // Child's exit code.
  bool parent_waiting;                 // Whether the parent is waiting on the child.

};

  // struct list child_map;             /**< Thread's children (key=tid, value=child_info). */
  struct list child_list;             /**< Thread's children. Member type is child_info. */
  struct child_info *parent_child_info;// Child_info of the thread in its parent's child_list.
  
  struct file *exec_file;             // Executable file.
  struct list file_list;              // List of opened files. Member type is file_entry.
  int next_fd;                        // Next file descriptor.

  struct semaphore sema_exec;         // Semaphore for loading executable.
  bool exec_success;                  // Whether the executable is successfully loaded.


```
>B2: Describe how file descriptors are associated with open files. Are file descriptors unique within the entire OS or just within a single process?

A thread's files structure maintains a record of an open file descriptor by setting its corresponding bit to "1" in the fd_set. When a file descriptor FD is opened, the fd_set's FD bit in the thread's files structure is set to 1, and fd_table[FD] points to the open file's file structure. However, file descriptors are only unique within a single process.

#### ALGORITHMS

>B3: Describe your code for reading and writing user data from the kernel.

check_read_user_ptr and check_write_user_ptr, that are used to validate the read and write permissions for a given user-provided pointer. These functions ensure that the pointer is valid and that every byte is safe to read or write.

To use these functions for parsing system call arguments, one can call check_read_user_ptr or check_write_user_ptr with the user-provided pointer and the size of the data to be read or written. For example, in the syscall_wait function, the check_read_user_ptr function is used to validate the user-provided pointer to the PID argument. Similarly, in the syscall_exec function, the check_read_user_str function is used to validate a user-provided string.

The check_read_user_str function is a specialized function for validating strings since the size of the string cannot be obtained through sizeof(char*), and its length is determined by the first occurrence of the null character '\0'. This function uses the get_user function to validate every byte of the string.

It is important to note that the system call number is also obtained by dereferencing a user-provided pointer and hence, it is essential to validate the pointer before accessing it.

>B4: Suppose a system call causes a full page (4,096 bytes) of data
>to be copied from user space into the kernel.  What is the least
>and the greatest possible number of inspections of the page table
>(e.g. calls to pagedir_get_page()) that might result?  What about
>for a system call that only copies 2 bytes of data?  Is there room
>for improvement in these numbers, and how much?

In the first scenario, the result is always 4096, and in the second scenario, it is always 2. However, the code can be improved by checking the bytes only once per page, which would require knowing the number of bytes to be checked. With this optimization, the minimum and maximum values for the first scenario would be 1 and 2, respectively. The second scenario remains unchanged.

>B5: Briefly describe your implementation of the "wait" system call
>and how it interacts with process termination.

The implementation of the "wait" system call involves designing parent-child relationships and storing information about child processes in a list. Each child process has a child_info structure that contains information such as its tid, exit code, and whether the parent is waiting for it. The parent process has a child_list that contains all of its child processes.

To implement the wait system call, the process_wait() function searches through the parent's child_list for the target child process. If the child process is still alive and has not been waited on before, the parent process waits for it to exit using a semaphore. If the child process has already been waited on, or if it does not exist in the child_list, -1 is returned. If the child process has already exited, the exit code is returned.

The implementation of wait interacts with process termination by storing information about the child process in its parent's child_list. When a child process terminates, it sets its alive flag to false and sets its exit code. If the parent process is waiting for it, the semaphore is upped to wake up the parent process.

>accesses, e.g. a "write" system call requires reading the system

>an error is detected, how do you ensure that all temporarily
>allocated resources (locks, buffers, etc.) are freed?  In a few
>paragraphs, describe the strategy or strategies you adopted for
>managing these issues.  Give an example.

To manage the issue of bad pointers causing process termination and error handling for system calls, the design strategy used is to uniformly check the syscall number and arguments. This allows for consistent error checking and handling across all system calls.

For system calls such as sys_read and sys_write, where errors due to bad pointers can occur, specific error handling is implemented based on the check result. In the case of a bad pointer error, the process is terminated. In other cases, an error code of -1 is returned to the calling process.

To ensure that all temporarily allocated resources such as locks and buffers are freed, locks are only used in routines with a single entry and a single exit. This ensures that any locks acquired at the entry will be released at the exit. For example, in sys_read, a buffer is used and is freed on every way out of the function to avoid any memory leaks.

By implementing uniform error handling for all system calls and ensuring that all resources are properly released, the primary function of the code is not obscured by a large amount of error-handling code. This approach helps to make the code more maintainable and easier to understand.

#### SYNCHRONIZATION

>B7: The "exec" system call returns -1 if loading the new executable
>fails, so it cannot return before the new executable has completed
>loading.  How does your code ensure this?  How is the load
>success/failure status passed back to the thread that calls "exec"?

To ensure that the "exec" system call does not return before the new executable has completed loading, the code uses a semaphore called sema_exec in the thread structure. The process_execute() function waits on this semaphore after creating a new thread to execute the command.

In the start_process() function that is executed by the new thread, the success or failure status of the executable load operation is stored in a success flag. If the load fails, the child process sets its alive flag to false, sets its exit code to -1, and up the semaphore for the parent process to know that the executable load has failed. The child process then exits.

If the load is successful, the child process sets its parent's exec_success flag to true and up the semaphore for the parent process to know that the executable has loaded successfully.

In process_execute(), the function checks the value of exec_success to determine if the new process has loaded its executable successfully. If it has not, the function returns -1 to the calling process.

By using the semaphore to wait for the new executable to load and setting flags to indicate the success or failure status, the code ensures that the "exec" system call does not return before the new executable has completed loading and that the success/failure status is passed back to the thread that calls "exec".

>B8: Consider parent process P with child process C.  How do you
>ensure proper synchronization and avoid race conditions when P
>calls wait(C) before C exits?  After C exits?  How do you ensure
>that all resources are freed in each case?  How about when P
>terminates without waiting, before C exits?  After C exits?  Are
>there any special cases?

To ensure proper synchronization and avoid race conditions when the parent process P calls wait(C), the child process C sets a flag parent_waiting to true and blocks on a semaphore wait_sema until it exits. When C exits, it sets its exit_code value and up the wait_sema, allowing the parent process to continue executing.

If P calls wait(C) after C exits, the process_wait() function checks for the child's exit status in the parent's child_list and returns the exit code if the child process has already exited. If the child process has not exited, the parent process is blocked on the wait_sema semaphore until the child process exits and signals the semaphore.

To ensure that all resources are freed in each case, the child process's child_info struct is heap-allocated so that it lives after the thread dies. When the child process exits, its child_info struct is removed from the parent process's child_list and freed. This ensures that all resources used by the child process are properly freed and prevents any memory leaks.

The use of semaphores and flags to synchronize the parent and child processes and the heap-allocation and proper freeing of resources in each case ensures that the program functions correctly and efficiently. This approach avoids race conditions and properly synchronizes the parent and child processes, while also ensuring that all resources are properly freed.

#### RATIONALE

>B9: Why did you choose to implement access to user memory from the
>kernel in the way that you did?

check only that a user pointer points below PHYS_BASE, then dereference it.
This technique is normally faster because it takes advantage of the processor's MMU, so it tends to be used in real kernels (including Linux).

>B10: What advantages or disadvantages can you see to your design
>for file descriptors?

Advantages:

The design provides a simple and intuitive way to manage file descriptors and opened files for each thread/process.
The use of a linked list to store opened files allows for easy addition and removal of file entries.
The use of a file_entry struct that stores both the file descriptor and the file pointer allows for efficient lookup and manipulation of opened files by their file descriptor.

Disadvantages:

The allocation of file descriptors may not be efficient, as it simply uses the next available integer starting from 2. This could potentially lead to a large number of unused file descriptors for some processes.
There is no mechanism for sharing file descriptors between threads or processes. This may limit the flexibility of the file system in certain use cases.
The design does not take into account file permissions or access control, which may be a security concern in certain scenarios.
